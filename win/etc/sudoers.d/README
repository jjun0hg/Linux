#
# The default /etc/sudoers file created on installation of the
# sudo  package now includes the directive:
# 
# 	@includedir /etc/sudoers.d
# 
# This will cause sudo to read and parse any files in the /etc/sudoers.d 
# directory that do not end in '~' or contain a '.' character.
# 
# Note that there must be at least one file in the sudoers.d directory (this
# one will do).
# 
# Note also, that because sudoers contents can vary widely, no attempt is 
# made to add this directive to existing sudoers files on upgrade.  Feel free
# to add the above directive to the end of your /etc/sudoers file to enable 
# this functionality for existing installations if you wish! Sudo
# versions older than the one in Debian 11 (bullseye) require the
# directive will only support the old syntax #includedir, and the current
# sudo will happily accept both @includedir and #includedir
#
# Finally, please note that using the visudo command is the recommended way
# to update sudoers content, since it protects against many failure modes.
# See the man page for visudo and sudoers for more information.
