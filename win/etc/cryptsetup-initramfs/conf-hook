# Configuration file for the cryptroot initramfs hook.
#

#
# KEYFILE_PATTERN: ...
#
# The value of this variable is interpreted as a shell pattern.
# Matching key files from the crypttab(5) are included in the initramfs
# image.  The associated devices can then be unlocked without manual
# intervention.  (For instance if /etc/crypttab lists two key files
# /etc/keys/{root,swap}.key, you can set KEYFILE_PATTERN="/etc/keys/*.key"
# to add them to the initrd.)
#
# If KEYFILE_PATTERN if null or unset (default) then no key file is
# copied to the initramfs image.
#
# Note that the glob(7) is not expanded for crypttab(5) entries with a
# 'keyscript=' option.  In that case, the field is not treated as a file
# name but given as argument to the keyscript.
#
# WARNING:
# * If the initramfs image is to include private key material, you'll
#   want to create it with a restrictive umask in order to keep
#   non-privileged users at bay.  For instance, set UMASK=0077 in
#   /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf
# * If you use cryptsetup-suspend, private key material inside the
#   initramfs will be in memory during suspend period, defeating the
#   purpose of cryptsetup-suspend.

# ASKPASS: [ y | n ]
#
# Whether to include the askpass binary to the initramfs image.  askpass
# is required for interactive passphrase prompts, and ASKPASS=y (the
# default) is implied when the hook detects that same device needs to be
# unlocked interactively (i.e., not via keyfile nor keyscript) at
# initramfs stage.  Setting ASKPASS=n also skips `cryptroot-unlock`
# inclusion as it requires the askpass executable.
